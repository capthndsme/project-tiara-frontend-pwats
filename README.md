Project TIARA is a smart doghouse system that has three components, the [Device Client](https://github.com/capthndsme/project-tiara-device-client-v2), the Server (this repo), and the [Web App](https://github.com/capthndsme/project-tiara-frontend-pwats). For more information, go to the [Project Tiara Repository](https://github.com/capthndsme/ProjectTiara) to learn more about the system.

Setup is easy, compile it like any React application, and make sure to edit the request urls to your backend.
